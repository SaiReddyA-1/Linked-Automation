ðŸš€ AI-Powered LinkedIn Automation Agent  

Iâ€™ve developed an AI-powered automation agent that simplifies the process of connecting with potential leads on LinkedIn. The system automates repeated manual tasks like:  
âœ… *Lead Generation* - Using Google API to gather relevant contacts.  
âœ… *Message Personalization* - AI-generated custom messages for each lead.  
âœ… *Automated Connection Requests* - Using Playwright scripts to send bulk connection requests with personalized notes.  

This project is called an "Agent" because it autonomously handles these repeated tasks, reducing manual effort and enhancing efficiency.  

âœ‰ *Upcoming Feature:* I'm also working on an *Email Outreach module* to directly send personalized emails with attachments like resumes or drive links.  

ðŸ”— *Deployed Test Website*:  
https://v0-front-end-application-design.vercel.app/  
(Backend isn't connected yet, as Playwright scripts canâ€™t run on the web deployment.)
